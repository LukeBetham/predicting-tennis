# Predicting Tennis
## Modeling Tennis Outcomes with Machine Learning

## General Assembly Capstone Project

How accurately can you predict who will win a tennis match given past data? 
In this project I use data from 30 years of tennis and around 75,000 professional individual matches to predict who is the likely winner of any given tennis match. 


Over the last 
My capstone project from the General Assembly immersive program. Here I predicted outcomes of tennis matches. I extracted the data using SQL and created symmetrical models using logistic regression, gradient boosters and neural nets. Using AWS infrastructure, I tuned the final model to beat the bookmakers.
