My capstone project from the General Assembly immersive program. Here I predicted outcomes of tennis matches. I extracted the data using SQL and created symmetrical models using logistic regression, gradient boosters and neural nets. Using AWS infrastructure, I tuned the final model to beat the bookmakers.
